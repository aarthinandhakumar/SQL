**Project Overview**

This project is designed to demonstrate various SQL techniques and database management skills. It includes the creation, manipulation, and querying of a database using SQL.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

SQL Server: Any relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or SQL Server.
SQL Client: A tool to interact with your database, such as MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code with a SQL extension.
Sample Data: Any sample data files provided with the project (e.g., CSV files for data import).

**Project Structure**

The project directory contains the following files:

SQL SCRIPT_TERM PROJECT: SQL script for importing data into the database.
README.md: This file, providing instructions on how to run the project.

**Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Setting Up the Database
Open your SQL Client:

Launch the SQL client you have installed on your machine.

2. Create the Database:

Open the SQL file in your SQL client.

Copy the script from line 32-436 to your SQL client and run the script.
You will be able to see the data in form of organized tables.

3. Running Queries

As you scroll down, you can see stored procedures based queries and various other queries under the respective headings (-- heading)

You will need to copy the code block and run it to view the data

To clear everything, use the drop commands at the very beginning of the page, to drop in the same order.

**Usage**

After setting up the database and importing the data, you can execute various SQL queries to perform operations such as:

Retrieving specific data sets.
Filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.
Updating or deleting records.
Joining tables to combine data from multiple sources.
Feel free to modify and extend the queries as needed for your specific use case.

**Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

Syntax Errors: Double-check the SQL syntax in your scripts.
Database Connection: Ensure your SQL client is properly connected to the database.
Permissions: Verify that your user account has the necessary permissions to create databases, tables, and perform data manipulations.
